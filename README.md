# AP: Activate-While-Pruning
Code for Paper -- AP: Selective Activation for De-sparsifying Pruned Networks

(1) Dependencies Required:

* Numpy

* Pandas

* Pytorch

* Scikit-Learn

(2) How to Run the Code?

* To obtain results of ResNet-20, please run resnet_20.py.

  Please note that the CIFAR-10 dataset will be automatically downloaded once the code is running. The ImageNet-200 is not uploaded due to its large size. Lastly, all experimental results will be saved in a local csv file. Please check the csv file for detailed results. 

(3) Description of Each Folder:

* arch: store all different neural network architectures.
 
* plots: save all plots
 
* saves: save some temporal files/models
 
* runs: save some results in each run

* dumps: save some dumped files
